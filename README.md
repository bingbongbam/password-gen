# password-gen
Okay so I'm basically using this as a basic starter project for python. Hopefully this can get me out of tutorial hell because I'm going to try to update it and make it better. As for what I want to add. I want to add the ability to include numbers and special characters, and I want to add a GUI later on after I have a good working secure password generator.
